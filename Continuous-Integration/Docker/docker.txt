//What is Docker? 🐳

Docker is a Containerization platform for packaging, deploying, and running 
applications as CONTAINERS..


// What is containerization? 📦
Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows you to 
encapsulate an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit called a 
"container"... 
Docker applications run in containers that can be used on any system: a developer’s 
laptop, systems on premises, or in the cloud. (it runs the same)..
Containers share the host operating system's kernel, but they have their own isolated 
file system, processes, and networking..
