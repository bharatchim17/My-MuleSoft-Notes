IP address for communication purposes..
Consist of two parts:
- A network address
- host address

The main Difference between IPv4 & IPv6 is length of address. IP version 4 is 32-bit 
IP version 6 is next generation of IP address and it has 128-bit hexadecimal address..
hexadecimal use both number and alphabets in address..

//In standard http, all information sent in clear text. HTTPS encrypt data using two
Protocols 
1.Secure Socket Layer(SSL)..
2.Transport Layer security(TLS)..
Protocol is used to ensure security on internet it, uses public key encryption to secure
data and authentificates te server , client and encrypt data..
TLS is cryptographic protocol and Successor to SSL..
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Transmition Control Protocol (TCP):
is connection oriented protocol that mean it acknowleged session between two computers
that are communicating by three-way handshake..
- generated data delivery..

User Datagram Protocol (UDP):
is connectionless oriented protocol is also known as fire and forget protocol..
- Not generated data delivery..
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Half-Duplex:
Can only communicate in one direction at a time..
Full-Duplex:
Can communicate in both direction at a time..
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Port forwarding:
Allows computer over the internet to connect to specific computer or services
within private network..
port is logical connection that is used by programs and services to exchange information..
port is always associated with an I.P. address..
---------------------------------------------------------------------
proxy server:
retrieves data on the internet on behalf of user as act like gentelmanðŸ˜…..
proxy benefits:
1. privacy:
Allows you to surf internet anonymously with using proxy , our public address isn't
visible..
2. Faster:
It save cache so , the request is process in proxy's database..

Disadvantage is proxy server can't encrypt data so , we can use vpn for it

//Virtual Private Network VPN:
- VPN encrypts data that's being transferred over the internet..
- It provides dedicated service tunnel between two points over internet..
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//What is firewall..?
