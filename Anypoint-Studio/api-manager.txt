//Mule API management:-
Is the process of designing , publishing , documenting , analyzing , versioning ,
securing and managing API users,traffic,SLAs.
Mulesoft has provided API management in two areas:
1. Mule Gateway API management
 - Mule Gateway
2. Universal API Management
 - Flex Gateway
 - Service Mesh

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 //Auto discovery:-
 Is the process of allowing API manager application to discover the application is running in
 the runtime using instance , ID is known as auto discovery..
 To enable auto discovery follow below steps:
 1. create auto discovery global element using API instance id.
 2. provide below runtime properties:
  - Organization buisness group client_id
  - Organization buisness group client_secret
 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Client id enforcement  policy:-
The client ID Enforcement policy restricts access to protected resource by allowing requests
only from registered client applications. The policy ensure that client credentials sents on 
each request have been approved to consume the API.

1. register client application on API in exchange.

2. specifies from where in the request to extract values:

  - HTTP Basic Authentification Header: Requires credentials as part of the authorization header.
 The application consuming the API must use the basic Authentification scheme to send the 
 credentials in the requests.
  - Custom Expression: Accepts an expression each for client_id and client_secret in the headers,
  indicating where to extract the credentials from request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Rate limiting policy:-
The Rate limiting policy enables you to limit the number of requests that an API can accept within
a time window. The API rejects any request that exceeds this limit .
You can configure multiple limits with window sizes ranging from milliseconds to years.

1. Apply configuration to all API method & resources.
2. Apply configuration to specific API method & resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Rate limiting SLA based policy:-
The rate limiting policy is combination of rate limiting and client id enforcement that enables you to 
limit the number of request specified by the level of access granted to the requesting application.
 1. Apply configuration to all API method & resources
 2. Apply configuration to specific API method & resources
 //steps:
 1. Add SLA tiers
 2. Create client Applications
 3. Apply rate limiting SLA based policy 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSON & XML threat protection policy:-

Applications processing JSON and XML requests are susceptible to attacks characterized 
by unusual inflation of elements and nesting levels. Attackers use recursive techniques
to consume memory resources. Dramatic swings in the size of the application data often 
 single a security problems. the JSON threat protection policy helps protect your applications 
 from such intrusions.
 If you find that attacks on your Anypoint platform setup are difficult to detect , design your services
 architecture with layers of protection in addition to JSON threat protection..
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//IP allow list & IP block list policies:-
The IP allow list policy allows a list or range of specified  IP address access to a protected
resource when a match is found between a source IP (specified when configuration the policy) and
a list of individual IPs or range of IPs.

The IP allow list policy controls access to a configured API endpoint from either a single 
IP address or range of IP addresses.

The IP Blocklist policy restricts access to a protected resources when a match is found between source IP 
(specified when configuring the policy) and either a list of individual IPs or range of IPs.

The IP blocklist policy controls access to a configured API endpoint from either 
a single IP address or range of IP addresses.

  1. Apply configuration to all API method & resources.
  2. Apply configuration to specific API method & resources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Proxy API:-
proxy API is a wrapper on actual application , we can go proxy API's in below scenarios.
  - When we would like to expose wrapper/proxy API on external services with own API management..
  - When we would like to expose with different end point on our mule applications..
  - When we would like to apply set of other policies on same services..
