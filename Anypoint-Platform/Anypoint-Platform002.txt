//Q. List different types of api ..?
//Q. What is stateless ..?
//Q. What is idompotent ..?

//Design principles of REST APIs 
- HTTP as application protocol
- resource Based 
- representation
- uniform interface
- stateless

//resources
- Nouns
it's resource based rather than action based (that's why not to write it like getBus , getHotel etc)
resources has two types:  1. Collection 2. Nested..
//what is differece between collection resource and Nested resource ?
In collection resource delete methode avoided in majority projects , in nested methode delete methode use in uri parameter

resource representation can be in different formats - XML , JSON etc , representations exchanged between consumer and provider..

//MediaType has two types:  1. Default  2. explicit 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

//Request contains:
        - body
        - headers
        - mediaType
        - uri_parameters
        - query_parameters
//request body must be required in post and patch method it not required in get and delete methode..

//Response contains:
        - HTTP status code
        - mediaType
        - body
        - headers
//response body not required in post and patch methode  it's required in get and delete methode but we can use anyway..

//Request Headers has two types:
1. Accept       ---e.g.-->  GET(collection and nested resources) / DELETE(nested resources)
2. Content-type ---e.g.-->  POST(collection resources) / PATCH(nested resources)

//Response Headers has two types:
1. Content-type  ---e.g.-->  GET(collection and nested resources) / DELETE(nested resources)
2. Location     ---e.g.-->  POST(collection resources) 

We use Error-response as content-type in project as per requirement
