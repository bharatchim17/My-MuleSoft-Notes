cloud operations on deployed mule applications..

//API's are individual to each Business group , they can't be accessd one from another.

//RAML Terminology:-

1.REST API URL :-
 http://localhost:8081/Domain_Name/v1/cases
    
    here: 
    Base URI :-  http://localhost:8081/Domain_Name
    Resource :-  v1/cases

2.HTTP Methods/Verbs:-
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Create: ----> Post
Read:----> Get ---> we use Get by url , form tag , hyperlink
Update:----> Put(Create + Update)|Patch(partially Update)
Delete
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Idompotent:
Idempotent methods are HTTP methods that have the same effect on the server, 
regardless of how many times they are executed. For example, GET, PUT, and DELETE are 
idempotent methods, because they always return the same resources , update the same 
resource, or remove the same resource respectively...

Idompotent:      --------> example:- Get|Put|Delete is Idompotent
Non-Idompotent:  --------> example: Post 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//RAML is a language for the definition of HTTP-based APIs that embody most or all 
of the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
RAML is a human & machine-readable language..

This document is organized as follows:-
-Basic Information
-Data Types
-Resources
-Methods
-Responses
-Resource Types and Traits
-Security
-Annotations
-Includes, Libraries, Overlays, and Extensions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//A template URI refers to a URI parameter, which is a variable element, enclosed 
in curly brackets ({}) inside a relative URI of a resource.

//title:- Label for the API.

//version:- API version

//baseUri:-  baseUri node specifies a URI as an identifier for the API as a whole...

//baseUriParameters:- The baseUriParameters node has the same semantics and therefore
 MUST follow the same structure as the uriParameters...

//protocols:-  [HTTP, HTTPS]

//mediaType: [ application/json , application/xml ]  | application/json  (it's Default Media Types)

//traits:- A trait, like a method, can provide method-level nodes such as a description,
 headers, query string parameters, and responses...

//annotationTypes:-  Annotation types, like data types, can extend other data types,
 but annotation types themselves can neither be extended nor used anywhere data types 
can be used...

(annotationName):-  An annotation is a map having a key that wrap in parentheses() 
is the annotation name, and the value is an instance(example) of that annotation.

//securitySchemes:- 
Whenever we develop a REST_service we apply Security on top of rest APIs.
Security can achieve in several ways, among that we use cofigure SQL certificates on 
mobile , applications or either individually through application or through muleSoft 
runtime dedicated load balancer , so that those services will be exposed as HTTPS 
services. Apart from that , we also apply security policies on top of these APIs.
Those are like basic authentification, client ID enforcement(injected through headers)
and oAuth security policies.

RAML supports the following built-in security scheme types:-	
OAuth 1.0
OAuth 2.0	
Basic Authentication	
Digest Authentication	
Pass Through	
x-{other}

securedBy:- The value assigned to the securedBy node MUST be a list of any of the 
security schemes previously defined in the securitySchemes.

//uses:- Imported external libraries for use within the API.

//relativeUri:- The resources of the API, identified as relative URIs that begin with 
a slash (/). A resource node is one that begins with the slash and is either at the 
root of the API definition or a child of a resource node. For example, /users and 
/{groupId}..

//description:- Human-friendly description of the API.

//schemas:-  An alias for the equivalent "types" node for compatibility with RAML 0.8 ,
 always use types..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//What are fragments in RAML?
fragment is part of root_file itself isn't a complete RAML specification just 
part(branch) of it..
These fragments can be data types, traits, resource categories, and many others.
API fragments are reusable components of RAML to make the Design and build of reusable 
API even quicker and easier.

API Fragments:- has two types
1. Local
2. Global 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//What is datatype..?
A data type describes the data expected in an API or returned by the API..
Datatype describes data in an API and add rules to validate data against type 
declaration..
there are two types of datatype 1. built-in datatype  2. custom data types..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//What are facets in RAML?
Types can define two types of member we can specialize types based on characteristics 
of facet values. use for adding some constraints/special configuration..

Common facets for all type declarations:
-  default , description , enum , example

Some are specific to type:
- Object:  properties , minProperties , maxProperties etc
- Array:   uniqueItems , minItems , maxItems
- String:  pattern , minlength , maxlength 
- integer: minimum , maximum , format , multipleOf

//enum facet used to specify the possible values for type..
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Mocking service:-
Is for to simulate behavior of API specification and explore API, tested by using test
link or public link and then we get response as http code , example..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Documentation: is reference guide for the API , Such documents can clarify how
 the API works or provide technical , functional and business context it define 
how API works and it contains title & content..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Anypoint-Exchange:- is repository which provides all Connectors to muleSoft.
//Templates:- are reusable project structures , we can create applications by using 
Templates.   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//resources
- Nouns
it's resource based rather than action based (that's why not to write it like getBus , getHotel etc)
resources has two types:  1.Collection(plural)  2.Nested(singular)..

//What is differece between collection resource and Nested resource ?
In collection resource delete method avoided in majority projects , in nested method
delete methode use in uri parameter..

resource representation can be in different formats - XML , JSON etc , representations
exchanged between consumer and provider..

//MediaType has two types:  1. Default  2. explicit 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS) is a constraint of the REST 
application architecture.
With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers 
provide information dynamically through hypermedia. A REST client needs little to no 
prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic 
understanding of hypermedia.

//What is HATEOS?

//Q. What is Representational ?
--> Is response return by server to client can be reprsent in format like json format 
{} or xml format <>

//Q. What is State? Does it mean session State?
--> state of resources in particular time

//resources are held by server
WebClient(browser)--->request(product/1)----->WebServer
WebServer---->response{product1: milk}----->WebClient
