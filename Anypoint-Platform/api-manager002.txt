--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Quality of service:

1. HTTP Caching: 
The HTTP Caching policy enables us to store HTTP responses from an API implementation
or an API proxy for reuse. To optimize against computation-heavy processing , this 
policy avoids performing multiple calls to the backend when the response of a service
does not change often. This policy uses a cache, which enables a faster service for 
data requests...

2. Rate limiting SLA based policy:
The Rate Limiting policy enables us to limit the number of requests that an API can
accept within a time window. The API rejects any request that exceeds this limit. 
SLA-based policies Impose a limit specified by the level of access granted to the 
requesting application. The Rate Limiting policy is SLA-based..
(The rate limiting policy is combination of rate limiting and client id enforcement 
that enables us to limit the number of request specified by the level of access 
granted to the requesting application)..
 
 //Steps:
 1. Add SLA tiers..
 2. Create client Applications..
 3. Apply rate limiting SLA based policy..


3. Rate limiting: 
The Rate Limiting policy enables us to limit the number of requests that an API 
can accept within a time window. The API rejects any request that exceeds this limit. 
we can configure multiple limits with window sizes ranging from milliseconds to years.
We can Apply configuration to all API method & resources or we can Apply specific 
API method & resources..

4. Spike Control:
The Spike Control policy enables us to manage API traffic. The policy ensures that 
within any given period of time, no more than the maximum configured requests are 
processed Spike control uses a sliding window algorithm. Over time, the window adjusts
to retain only the processed information that fits within the window time span..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Security:

1. OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement using Mule OAuth Provider:
The Mule OAuth 2.0 Provider policy enables us to alternatively use the OAuth 2.0 
authentication, designed by Mulesoft, which is an open standard for token-based 
authentication over the internet. Mule OAuth authenticates consumers and service 
providers using tokens instead of passwords...

2. XML Threat Protection:
XML requests are susceptible to attacks characterized by unusual inflation of 
elements, attributes, and nesting levels. Attackers use recursive techniques to 
consume memory resources. Dramatic swings in the size of the application data often 
signal a security problem The XML Threat Protection policy enables us to protect 
our applications from such intrusions..

3. Json Threat Protection:
JSON requests are susceptible to attacks characterized by unusual inflation of 
elements and nesting levels. Attackers use recursive techniques to consume memory 
resources. Dramatic swings in the size of the application data often signal a security
problem. The JSON threat Protection policy enables us to protect our applications 
from such intrusions...

4. IP Allowlist:
The IP Allowlist policy enables us to allow a list or range of IP addresses to access
and interact with a configured API endpoint. This policy behaves in a manner opposite 
to that of the IP Blocklist policy. we can allowlist addresses for our API endpoints
based on the: 
1. IP address of the request
2. Origin IP address of the x-Forwarded-For header..

5. Basic Authentication-Simple:
The Simple authentication policy enables us to enforce security for the APIs by 
requiring applications to provide a username and password when making a request...

6. Basic Authentication-LDAP:
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication policy enables us to 
establish the configuration details for an Open LDAP or Active Directory LDAP that 
we set up for our enterprise...

7. IP Blocklist
The IP Blocklist policy enables us to restrict a list or range of IP addresses from 
accessing and interacting with a configured API endpoint. we can blocklist addresses 
for our API based on the:
1. IP address of the request..
2. Origin IP address of the x-Forwarded-For header..

8. JWT Validation:
we can use a JSON Web Token (JWT) to transfer information between parties as a JSON 
object. Because the token is signed, we can trust the information and its emitter.
The JWT Validation policy enables us to validate incoming requests using a JWT with 
JWS format. The policy verifies the signature of the token and asserts the values of 
the claims...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Troubleshooting:

1. Message Logging:
The Message Logging policy enables us to log a custom message with the information 
available from policies, a proxy, or the backend, at any point of the execution.This 
policy works with both log4j and log4j2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Transformation:

1. Header Removal:
The Header Removal policy removes headers from the request and response of a message. 
The content-type and content-length headers of a request can be filtered using this 
policy...

2. Header Injection:
The Header Injection policy enables us to add headers to the request and response 
of a message. If the injected header already exists in the message attributes, the 
policy creates a new header, without overriding the value of the existing one. This 
action creates two headers with the same name...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//Compliance:

1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing:
The cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy enables us to access resources in 
another domain using a web application. For example, browsers rely on this standard 
for allowing cross-origin requests...

2. Client ID Enforcement:
The Client ID Enforcement policy enables us to restrict access to a protected 
resource. Only HTTP requests specifying client application credentials that are 
already registered with target APIs are approved. The policy validates the Client ID 
and Client Secret of a client application created within an Anypoint Platform 
organization. This policy does not validate client application credentials that are 
generated outside of Anypoint Platform...
1. register client application on API in exchange.
2. specifies from where in the request to extract values..
  - HTTP Basic Authentification Header: Requires credentials as part of the 
authorization header.
 The application consuming the API must use the basic Authentification scheme to send the 
 credentials in the requests.
  - Custom Expression: Accepts an expression each for client_id and client_secret in the headers,
indicating where to extract the credentials from request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:- If our API is not showing ACTIVE in API Manager, that means , either the api ID 
is mismatched that we have given in our code and the value in API Manager, or The 
Anypoint platform credentials are wrong. When Status is “Un Registered “ That means , 
our policies are not appended. But still application works without having Policies appended...
