SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for execute queries , retrieve data , accessing and manipulating databases ,
SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is the basis for SQL , and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries .

//CREATE DATABASE databasename;

//SHOW DATABASES;

//DROP DATABASE databasename;

//BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath';
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;

Always back up the database to a different drive than the actual database. Then, if you get a disk crash, you will not lose your backup file along with the database.
A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup.


//CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);


//The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
